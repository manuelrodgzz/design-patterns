#  Factory Method
##  Intent

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

##  Applicability

- 🐞 Use the Factory Method when you don’t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.

- ⚡️ The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code.
For example, to add a new product type to the app, you’ll only need to create a new creator subclass and override the factory method in it.

- 🐞 Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.

- ⚡️ Inheritance is probably the easiest way to extend the default behavior of a library or framework. But how would the framework recognize that your subclass should be used instead of a standard component?
The solution is to reduce the code that constructs components across the framework into a single factory method and let anyone override this method in addition to extending the component itself.
Let’s see how that would work. Imagine that you write an app using an open source UI framework. Your app should have round buttons, but the framework only provides square ones. You extend the standard `Button` class with a glorious `RoundButton` subclass. But now you need to tell the main `UIFramework` class to use the new button subclass instead of a default one.
To achieve this, you create a subclass `UIWithRoundButtons` from a base framework class and override its `createButton` method. While this method returns `Button` objects in the base class, you make your subclass return `RoundButton` objects. Now use the `UIWithRoundButtons` class instead of `UIFramework`. And that’s about it!
