# Composite

## Intent
Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

## Applicability
- Use the Composite pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.

- The Composite pattern provides you with two basic element types that share a common interface: simple leaves and complex containers. A container can be composed of both leaves and other containers. This lets you construct a nested recursive object structure that resembles a tree.

- Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.

- All elements defined by the Composite pattern share a common interface. Using this interface, the client doesnâ€™t have to worry about the concrete class of the objects it works with.
