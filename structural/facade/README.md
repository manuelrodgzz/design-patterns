# Facade

## Intent
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Applicability
- Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.

- Often, subsystems get more complex over time. Even applying design patterns typically leads to creating more classes. A subsystem may become more flexible and easier to reuse in various contexts, but the amount of configuration and boilerplate code it demands from a client grows ever larger. The Facade attempts to fix this problem by providing a shortcut to the most-used features of the subsystem which fit most client requirements.

- Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.

- Create facades to define entry points to each level of a subsystem. You can reduce coupling between multiple subsystems by requiring them to communicate only through facades.
For example, letâ€™s return to our video conversion framework. It can be broken down into two layers: video- and audio-related. For each layer, you can create a facade and then make the classes of each layer communicate with each other via those facades. This approach looks very similar to the Mediator pattern.
